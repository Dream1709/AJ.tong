# Tailwind setup

Quick steps:

- Install dev dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

- Build CSS once:

```bash
npm run build:css
```

- Or watch for changes during development:

```bash
npm run watch:css
```

The `open.html` file includes the Tailwind CDN for immediate use and will use `dist/styles.css` when you build locally.
